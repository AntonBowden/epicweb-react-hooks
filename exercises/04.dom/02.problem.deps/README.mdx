# Dependencies

👨‍💼 Our users wanted to be able to control `vanilla-tilt` a bit. Some of them
like the speed and glare to look different. So Kellie 🧝‍♂️ added a form that will
allow them to control those values. The trouble is when the users change the
values, the vanilla tilt element isn't updated with the new values.

🦉 React needs to know when it needs to run your effect callback function again.
We do this using the dependency array which is the second argument to
`useEffect`. Whenever values in that array changes, React will call the returned
cleanup function and then invoke the effect callback again.

So far we've provided an empty dependency array which effectively tells React
that the effect doesn't depend on any values from the component. This is why the
effect is only run once when the component mounts and when values change it's
not run again.

By default, if you don't provide a second argument, `useEffect` runs after every
render. While this is probably the right default for correctness, it's far from
optimal in most cases. If you're not careful, it's easy to end up with infinite
loops (imagine if you're calling `setState` in the effect which triggers another
render and so on).

👨‍💼 So what we need to do in this step is let React know that our effect callback
depends on the `vanillaTiltOptions` the user is providing. Let's do that by
passing the `vanillaTiltOptions` in the dependency array.

	to increment the count, the tilt effect is reset! We'll fix this in the next
