# Add Game History Feature

👨‍💼 Sometimes users are playing tic-tac-toe against their children and their kids
want to change their move when they lose 😆 So we're going to add a feature that
allows users to go backward through the game and change moves.

As usual, you can check <Link to=".?preview=solution">the solution</Link> to
check what the final experience should be like.

🧝‍♂️ I made a couple changes you can <DiffLink app1={-1}>check here</DiffLink> if
you'd like. I mostly just refactored things a bit to get it ready for your work.
Should be a fun feature to add! Enjoy!
